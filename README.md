# Calendar Chatbot Agent (WIP)

A simple AI assistant that helps schedule and manage meetings via natural language.

## Goal
Build a GPT-based chatbot that connects to Google Calendar and responds to commands like:
- "Book a meeting with John on Friday at 2pm"
- "Cancel my 10am meeting tomorrow"
- "List my events for next week"

## Tools & Stack
- Python
- LangChain (agent logic)
- Google Calendar API (free)
- OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo, free tier)
- Streamlit (simple UI)

## Project Structure
(Coming soon)
